# Duarte's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This web page showcases my journey, projects, and the technologies I enjoy working with. Itâ€™s built with performance, clarity, and clean design in mind.


### ðŸš€ Tech Stack

I used my preferred tech stack, which is fast, efficient and familiar:

    Vite â€“ Blazing-fast development environment and build tool

    React â€“ Powerful and flexible front-end library

    TypeScript â€“ Static typing for improved development experience and reliability

    Chakra UI â€“ Accessible and responsive component library for sleek interfaces 

    React Icons â€“ Versatile icon library (react-icons/fa)
